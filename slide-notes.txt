1. What is Molecular Dynamics?
    - All-atom simulation of aquaporin with a lipid membrane and explicit 
      solvent.
    - Not just an animation, it's physics-based!
    - Simulation from Bert de Groot's lab

2. What is Molecular Dynamics Used For?
    - Before simulating everything, consider whether it is useful for the 
      application
    - Does it address the biological question? Can it generate new testable 
      hypotheses?
    - Can you validate it?
    - Are these assumptions and approximations ok? Ex: This assumes classical 
      physics - no bond breaking. 
    - Time-scale problem (While there are some microsecond long simulations in 
      this presentation, even on specialized supercomputers, these took months 
      to perform)
    - If these don't hold, consider a different approach

3. Observing protein motion at the atomic level
    - Main point here is that proteins move
    - Simulations capture this - static experimental structures don't (although 
      Jaime Fraser's RT xtallography work does address these limitations)
    - Simulation is of barstar, a ribonuclease inhibitor.

4. Simulating dynamic processes
    - Life exists because of dynamic processes
    - And we can simulate some of these

5. Watch a protein fold over 6 microseconds
    - Protein folding at atomic resolution (not many experimental techniques 
      can get this info)
    - This is an unrestrained explicit solvent simulation of the protein 
      (performed by Schulten's lab at UIUC)
    - Villin headpiece is a fast folding protein which allows its folding to be 
      observable by MD. (Still, six microseconds is really long for MD and took 
      months in wall-clock time to complete.)

6. Observe a conformational change
    - EGF Receptor undergoes massive conformational change upon ligand 
      disassociation
    - Movie is smoothed, so it looks like a typical animation, but it is a 
      physics-based MD sim (performed by Shaw's group).
    - MD allows us to observe conformational changes (here a large one because 
      of the massive computational resources that Shaw's group has access to), 
      along with the atomic details.

7. Follow a water molecule through aquaporin
    - They should have read the aquaporin paper for their discussion - here is 
      a simulation by another group, de Groot's Lab (Iâ€™d have to double check 
      whether it is the same one).
    - A single molecule is colored in yellow and you can watch it cross the 
      membrane
    - MD is cool because you can observe these transport mechanisms at the 
      atomic level. (At UCSF, Bill DeGrado studies other transporter systems;
      uses MD as a tool to complement other experimental biophysical 
      techniques.)

8. Understanding experimental data
    - Refinement of experimental structures often uses MD - like in Simulated 
      Annealing. This can be applied for different experimental data 
      (xtallography, NMR, EM)
    - The movie shows 3D structures that are all consistent with the NMR data, 
      and this was determined by MD (Simulated annealing with MD) that 
      incorporates experimental data (here, NMR distance restraints).
    - Charles will expand more on sampling techniques and methods that combine 
      physics with other things like experimental data more generally. But 
      wanted to demonstrate that MD is a method that can be used not only for 
      simulation, but for structure determination, too.

9. Want to learn more
    - As for labs at UCSF, Jacobson lab is probably the best for delving into 
      MD. But if they are just interested in labs that apply MD, the Sali lab, 
      too. DeGrado lab has computational students/postdocs that use MD. Other 
      experimental labs have collaborations and joint students, for example, 
      the Agard lab and Fletterick lab have joint students with Jacobson lab.
